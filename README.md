UIKit-Dynamics-Example
======================

An example of a sidebar menu animated completely with UIKit Dynamics on iOS 7. See [this tutorial](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/introduction-to-uikit-dynamics/) for more info. 

First, we demonstrate how to use instantaneous force to bounce the menu:

Then we show how to use attachment behaviours and gravity reversal to open the menu with a swipe from the left edge of the screen.
